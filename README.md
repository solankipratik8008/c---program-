# c---program-

thi is my c# program whre i created one self-shopping cart which has some conditions like 

•	The cannot buy the same item twice in the same transaction.
•	The program should handle multiple items, and each must have its own specific price.
•	The input validation should ensure that erroneous or unexpected input values (e.g., negative weights, invalid item names) trigger appropriate error messages, not crashes.
•	Include an option for the user to enter item information in any order (item first, weight or quantity, then bags and loyalty card). The program should sort the inputs appropriately.
•	A 13% tax is applied to the subtotal to calculate the grand total.
